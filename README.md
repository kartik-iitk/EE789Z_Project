# Wind Power Forecasting

This repository contains my submission for the course project in **Mathematical Engineering and Physics using Machine Learrning** (EE798R) conducted at IIT Kanpur, by [Dr. Sandip Tiwari](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278303900).

## My Details

- Name - Kartik Anant Kulkarni
- Roll no. - 210493

## How to Run?

I have trained and tested the code on an _OSX-ARM_ Architecture in a `Python 3.11` _miniforge_-based environment.

### Setup Environment

`cd` to the repository's main directory:

```
conda create --name MEPML --file environment.yml
```

### Add Dataset

Download and extract the dataset to the `./Datasets` folder.

### Code Organisation

The code is organised in 3 files: `src/phase1.ipynb`, `src/phase2.ipynb`, `src/phase3.ipynb` which has the code used to obtain results for each phase as mentioned in the project report.
